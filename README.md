### 1. [Dental X-ray Analysis](http://ijatca.com/archives/Volume8/Number1/sm21080110)
- **Published:** IJATCA/Volume 8, 2021
- **Summary:** This project focuses on analyzing dental radiographs using advanced neural networks and transfer learning techniques to achieve precise results. By leveraging the MobileNet architecture, enhanced with additional neural network layers, the model effectively identifies caries in x-rays, providing output as a probability value. This approach enables dentists to quickly and accurately assess dental x-rays, saving time and improving diagnostic efficiency. The Flask based web application ensures high accuracy and reliable performance in real-world scenarios.
